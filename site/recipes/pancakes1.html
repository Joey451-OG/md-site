            <h3>Instructions (cont.)</h3>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><p>
                    Continue folding the batter until most large lumps of flour are gone. Be careful not to
                    over-mix your batter as the pancakes will not rise when cooking.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Do not grease your pan! The butter in the batter acts as a built in lubricant and prevents
                    you from adding too much grease. Pour the batter on the pan in and tilt the pan to evenly
                    distribute the batter if needed. You're aiming for less than one centimeter in height.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    When bubble form over the majority of the surface, flip the pancake. Then wait at least
                    five seconds before testing to see if the bottom is cooked. This takes lots of practice 
                    and patience. If you think pancake is too tall, use a butter knife to cut into the middle
                    of the pancake and test to see if is is fully cooked on the inside. If it is, take off 
                    the pan. You may also want to adjust your heat to get the perfect temperature. 
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    Serve hot with a sweet, wet condiment. Enjoy! :D 
                </p></li>
