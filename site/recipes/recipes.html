                This is a listing of all recipes saved to this website, along side their original source. Most recipes I find
                are <i>sehr lecker</i>, however are tainted by pages of filler content designed to show you as many ads as possible.
                Here I provide each recipe in full, with one image of the final product, a short description, ingredients, instructions,
                and a few tips I have found useful. Enjoy!  
            </p>
