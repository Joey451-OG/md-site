            <p>As is habit I walk. Bare back. 8 kilometers. 32 degrees above freezing. I call it "heat resistance training".</p>
            <p>
                1 kilometer. Going strong, I keep my back straight and monitor my pace. <br>
                2 kilometer. I take a sip from my drink. A quarter done. <br>
                3 kilometer. 4 kilometer. 5 kilometer. All is well. Heart rate high, sweat normal. <br>
                6 kilometer. Water is finished. Mind thirst and adjust accordingly next week. <br>
                7 kilometer. Hands swell. Clench fists. Noticeable blood pumps. Heat Exhaustion imminent. <br>
                8 kilometer. Training done. <br>
                <i><b>Why do I do this?</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I force down more water, its' nauseating but I need it. Dazed and dizzy I stumble my way through 
                a shower and then lie in bed. I turn on my television. The man on screen talks about existential 
                ideas. Ideas of free will and its' enteral tension with predestination that a seaming deterministic 
                world suggests. Ideas of determinism in its' basic form. Ideas of time, and future, and past, and 
                present, all laid out on a plane as if one was outside our four dimensional universe. <br>
                <i><b>What is the point?</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The man speaks clearly. I like his beard. His words demand thought, reflection, sincerity. I am but 
                a sponge, I soak in syllables <code>&#8212;</code> placing them into the corners of my mind where my consciousness 
                mere moments in the future can process and understand them. I am but too dazed for instantaneous 
                understanding. <br>
                <i><b>Is anyone ever un-dazed? Can we ever see clearly?</b></i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The video ends. I perform my due diligence, leave a like, move on. I click on another bearded man. 
                This man tells me things I already know. There is diversity in belief. No two moments are the same. 
                I understand. I close my eyes, the man's voice is nice. It is dark. Dark. Faded voice.

                Dark. Darkness. UNKNOWN. 
            </b></p>
            <p>
                Eyes open. No light. Slowly, there is light. I turn over. I had slept. <br>
                <i><b>Why did I wake up?</b></i>
            </p>
            <p><i><b>
                I didn't want to wake up.
            </b></i></p>
            <p><i><b>
                Should I be sorry?
