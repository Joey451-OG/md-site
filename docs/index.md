# Hi!
I'm [Joseph Garnaeu](about.md), but most people call me Joey. Glad you made it to my little corner of the web :D  

This site is running off a raspberry pi in my small apartment and I've been using it as a remote server for most of my small projects.  

But **what about this webstite?** I generally use it to gush about larger projects I'm working on like [the first hackathon at my university](hack.md), and a small old-school [blog](#the-blog) on the main page.  

Thanks for visiting!! -Joey
